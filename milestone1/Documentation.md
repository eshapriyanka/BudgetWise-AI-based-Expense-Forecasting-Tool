* Provide Proactive Alerts: To issue real-time budget alerts to users when they are at risk of overspending in a particular category.

## 4.0 Project Scope
The scope of the project is defined by the flow of data from input to output.
* Input: The system will accept expense data from various sources, such as uploaded CSV files or through API integration with bank feeds or Google Sheets.
* Processing: The core of the tool involves pre-processing the data, performing feature engineering, and applying a suite of AI/ML models to analyze and forecast spending patterns.
* Output: The final output will be delivered to the user through an interactive dashboard that provides spending forecasts, budget alerts, and actionable financial insights.

## 5.0 Methodology and System Architecture
The project follows a structured lifecycle, progressing from data handling to model deployment;
* Data Ingestion & Pre-processing: Acquiring and cleaning expense data.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding patterns and trends in the data.
* Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features to improve model performance.
* Machine Learning Modeling: Implementing and training various forecasting models.
* Deep Learning Modeling: Utilizing advanced models like LSTMs for complex patterns.
* Dashboard & Visualization: Building a user-facing application to display results.
* Deployment: Hosting the application on a cloud platform.

## 5.1 Feature Engineering
To enhance model accuracy, several features will be engineered from the raw data:
* Time-Based Features: Extracting components like the month, day of the week, and seasonality.
* Behavioral Features: Calculating cumulative spending patterns to understand user habits over time.
* Categorical Features: Grouping expenses into logical categories (e.g., groceries, transport, entertainment).

## 6.0 Forecasting Models
The tool will implement and compare several forecasting models to ensure the highest accuracy.

### 6.1 Time Series Models: ARIMA/SARIMA
Time series models are ideal for data with clear temporal trends.
They are effective at capturing seasonality and cyclical patterns in spending data.
Specific models to be implemented include ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA).

### 6.2 Prophet Model
Developed by Facebook, Prophet is a powerful and user-friendly forecasting model.
It is robust in handling seasonality and holidays, which are common in expense data.
It offers a simple API and produces fast, reliable results.

### 6.3 Deep Learning Models: RNNs & LSTMs
For more complex and long-term forecasting, advanced deep learning techniques will be used.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are specifically designed for sequential data like monthly expenses.
These models excel at capturing long-term dependencies in spending habits that simpler models might miss.

### 6.4 Anomaly Detection
The system will also include a module to identify unusual spending activities. This helps users quickly spot potential fraudulent transactions or significant deviations from their normal budget, such as a sudden large purchase.

## 7.0 Model Evaluation
The performance of all forecasting models will be rigorously evaluated using standard statistical metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.

$$MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|$$

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): The square root of the average of squared differences between prediction and actual observation. It gives a higher weight to large errors. 

$$RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}$$

Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): Expresses the accuracy as a percentage of the error. 

$$MAPE = \frac{100\%}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left| \frac{y_i - \hat{y}_i}{y_i} \right|$$

## 8.0 Application Layer and Features
The user-facing application will be a key component, providing an intuitive interface to interact with the AI-powered insights.
